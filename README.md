# LinkedIn Feed Filter Chrome Extension

## Overview
The LinkedIn Feed Filter Chrome Extension allows users to filter their LinkedIn feed by highlighting and saving specific text. Posts containing the saved text will be hidden from the feed, helping users create a more personalized and mentally healthy browsing experience.

The project is inspired by the idea that "comparison is the thief of joy." By reducing exposure to content that may trigger unnecessary comparisons or negative feelings, users can focus on meaningful interactions and professional growth on LinkedIn.
